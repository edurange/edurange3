TOTAL_RECON: About: Total Recon is a story-based game designed to teach how network protocols such as TCP, UDP, and ICMP can be used to reveal information about a network. Total Recon focuses on reconnaissance to determine hosts in an unknown network. You will explore tradeoffs between speed and stealth when using tools such as nmap. Learning Objectives 1. Understand how the networking protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP) can be exploited for recon. 2. Know how to use nmap to find hosts and open ports on a network 3. Recognize the standard common ports (e.g. SSH, FTP, HTTP, SMTP, IMAP) 4. Understand the TCP flags and how they can be used for different types of scans 5. Understand CIDR network configuration and how to subdivide a network IP range.
