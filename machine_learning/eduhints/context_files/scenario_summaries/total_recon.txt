TOTAL_RECON: The student is tasked with completing a series of challenges involving SSH (Secure Shell) and other security-related concepts. These tasks include using nmap to perform network scans, using netmask or CIDR notation to efficiently select what network range to scan, using nc if nmap is unavailable, scanning uncommon or disguised ports, jump from one network location to another, and finally reach the edge of the network and use find and chmod to disarm the reactor. Often the networks will be very large, so a very good strategy is to narrow your scan range as much as you can with the clues provided. Nmap by default will only scan the 1000 most commonly used ports (not numerically 1 through 1000), so you may need to use the -p option to check non-standard ports. Some nmap scans are slower than others, but if your range is too large it may not matter what type of scan you're trying. Throughout these tasks, the student must learn and apply various techniques and commands to progress, with the ultimate goal of mastering network navigation.
