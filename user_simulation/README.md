For the first time running, be sure to run
```
./simulation_setup.sh
```
to install the necessary packages. Note that the current simulation will work for the Ubuntu 22.04 / Firefox setup or a Chrome setup. From there, run the ```simulate_user.py``` script, and enter "n" when prompted for using previous settings.

The script will save the settings you enter in to a new file, called ```saved_info```, which you can then reuse/overwrite in subsequent runs.

Example info:
```

creds.txt
edurange.local
simulation_test
```
