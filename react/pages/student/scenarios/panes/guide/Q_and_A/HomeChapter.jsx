        To play a scenario, connect with SSH! 
        You can either connect with your native Linux, MacOS, or PowerShell terminal (recommended), or our own in-browser ssh terminal.
        Both can be found on the info pane to the left of this guide pane (in-browser SSH terminal button at bottom of info pane).👈

        <br></br>
        Each challenge in the SSH game is paired with a question in this window, so when you find a secret answer or flag,
        come back to this window, and enter your answer into the provided field.  If you got the right answer, you will be awarded points!
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        If you're having trouble, check out some of the challenge-specific resources or our FAQ(link). Both can be found in the Info pane on the left. 👈
        If you're still having trouble, you can ask for help in the chat!
        <br></br>
