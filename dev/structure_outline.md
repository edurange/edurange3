The notes in this doc are my sketchy/preliminary suggestions
in regards to changes that could be made from the current structure to
a new one.  

These are only my suggestions, and not set in stone, nor is it complete.  However,
as long as this document is here, we should try to keep it mostly accurate
to whatever we decide (or delete it).

  # loose python files should be moved into /flask or maybe /py_scripts

  # all of /edurange_refactored (which essentially was the flask/jinja 
  #   directory in function) should be ported; 
  #   so: broken up and either removed or moved elsewhere;
  
  # templates directory (for jinja, gone)

  # webpack (fully replaced by vite, gone)
  # webpack's static/build will be gone; taken care of by vite

  # other than that it's mostly the new flask routes/config and react, both redundant to above scheme

  # tutorials (deprecated i think)

  # minimal anything else in root
