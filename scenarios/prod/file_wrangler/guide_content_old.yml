            Steps:
            1. View the manual entry for the `ls` command. Notice in the `SYNOPSIS`, the format of the command is as follows:

               `ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...`

               Anything in square brackets is optional. In this case, we can use `ls` along with one of the options listed with `-` or `--` and we could add a complete file path.

            2. Scroll through the manual to find the option that will provide a long listing format for the `ls` command.
            3. Answer question 4 in EDURange.
