      ### How to Connect
      Use the credentials and IP address provided in the bottom left of this 
      scenario page to SSH into the exercise. 
      
      SSH is an important network protocol that is used in most of our 
      scenarios, so you need some minimal knowledge on how to use it on your OS.
      
      If you need a backup, you can use the WebSSH button also in the bottom 
      left, but it is missing many convenience features provided by more 
      standard terminals.

      “*`man` pages*" is short for “**man**ual” pages. These are text documents
      with lots of information on things installed on your system. “`man`” is a
      command for reading the `man` pages.

      Try opening the "`man`" page for `ls` using:
      ```
      man ls
      ```
      To exit `man`, just type "`q`" to “***q**uit*”.

      ### `man` Page Key Points: SYNOPSIS and EXAMPLES

      For many commands, there’s an overwhelming amount of information in the `man` pages. The pages are divided up into sections.

      Most every `man` page includes two particularly useful sections:

      - A *synopsis* showing how the command is written in the format discussed earlier, and 
      - A series of *examples* showing exact instances of the command in particular uses.

      When in a `man` page, you can type a slash “`/`” to search for text.

      The headers are in all capitals, so after opening up a particular page, to search for the synopsis you’d type:

      ```sh
      /SYNOPSIS
      ```

      and then hit enter.

      - `man` will highlight all instances of the text “`SYNOPSIS`”.
      - Typing “`n`” will bring you to the “**n**ext” search result.
      - “`b`” will take you “**b**ack”.
      - Remember, “`q`” to “**q**uit” when you’re done.

      - `man` pages are an important resource because they are specific to the software actually installed on the system you’re currently using.
      - Some commands have different behavior depending on their version.
      - An online resource may or may not have information specific to your system, but `man` always contains documentation for what you have installed.

      ### Exploring the Filesystem with ls

      Let's take a look at what files are in our current folder using "`ls`"

      Type:
      ```
      ls
      ```

      You should see something similar to:
      
      ```
      bar               followMe         navigation_check.txt  you_cant_read_me.txt
      comms_record.txt  for_hire.txt     permit_requests
      file-practice     i                radio_logs.txt
      final-task        multimedia-data  toLearn
      ```

      These are all the files and directories in your current directory. Files with different extensions, as well as directories, may be different colors.

      ### pwd
      So where are we exactly? We can use "`pwd`" to find out. 

      `pwd` stands for "***p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory*" - it will tell you where you are within the filesystem, your current working directory.
      
      To learn more type `man pwd`. (Remember, type `q` to exit when you're done with `man`.)
      
      ### cd
      
      “`cd`” stands for “***c**hange **d**irectory*”, meaning to navigate to a different folder. If you ever are lost in the filesystem, `cd` by itself will take you back to your home directory.
      
      Enter each of the following, one at a time. If you use `ls` after each, you’ll see that your working directory is changing:
      
      ```sh
      cd /
      cd /root
      cd
      cd ../
      ```
      
      - The first command sends you to the root of your entire file system.
      - The second command sends you to the root user's home directory, but notice that you don't have permissions to `cd` to that directory.
      - The third command sends you back to your home directory because no path was specified with the command.
      - The fourth command sends you backwards (up) a level (remember the `..` above).


      ### ls and File Access Control
      As mentioned before, “`ls`” “***l**i**s**ts*” files and directories.
      
      - We’ve already seen a little of what `ls` can do. But as we mentioned earlier, there are arguments and options you can give a command to change how it behaves.
      
      First make sure you’ve returned to your home directory -
      
      ```sh
      cd
      ```
      
      Try -
      
      ```sh
      ls -la
      ```
      
      That's a lot of info! What you see are all the files and directories in the directory (folder) where you are currently working, including files that were hidden before!
      - The first column contains symbols describing the permissions set on that file or directory, more on that later.
      - The second column is the number of links or sub-directories in the directory, if this file is a directory. (In Unix, we tend to think of all things as files; even directories are just a special type of file.)
      - The third column is the user that owns the file.
      - The fourth is the group that owns the file.
      - The fifth is the size of the file.
      - The sixth is the date and time it was last edited.
      - And finally, the file name in the seventh column, on the far right.

      Files whose name begin with a "." are considered *hiddden*

      Hidden files aren’t hidden in the “secret” sense as much as they are just “*hidden from view*” to reduce visual clutter. Hidden files are often used to store configuration and other information that might repeat in many places and would be distracting if it showed up all the time.

      #### Tab Completion:
      One very useful trick to save typing is that you can hit tab after partially typing the name of a file to autocomplete it.
      If there's only one file or directory, you won't even need to start typing after leading with your command.
      Try using tab completion with "`cd`" to find out what's at the end of the  "followMe" directory.

      ### Globbing With ls
      
      If there are a lot of files in a directory, it can be useful to restrict what `ls` looks at to a subset of those files. The shell allows you to do that with paths that describe a pattern. This is called “*globbing*”. For example, if you are only interested in files with the extension “`.jpg`”, you can use:
      
      ```sh
      ls *.jpg
      ```
      
      The “`*`” “star” is a special character called a “*wildcard*”. Wildcards represent a part of the pattern that could vary. `*` specifically means that any substring could occur in that position of the *glob pattern*.    
      
      So the “`*.jpg`” means any string followed by “`.jpg`”, including just “`.jpg`” by itself - the empty string is still a string, so it satisfies the pattern.
      
      We’ll discuss and use *globs* more later on.

      ## Commands: mv, cp, and mkdir
      ### mv
  
      You can use `mv` to move the filename and not just the directory it’s in, so there is no separate command to “rename” a file - renaming is the same as `mv`ing it from one name to another in the same directory.
                
      ### cp
                
      `cp` is used to “***c**o**p**y*” a file to a new location.
                
      ### mkdir
                
      `mkdir` is short for “***m**a**k**e **dir**ectory*” and does just what you’d think.

      ### `chmod`

      `chmod` comes from “***ch****ange* ***mod****e*” and alters the *permissions* of files and directories.

      - “*Permissions*”, mentioned earlier with regard to `ls -l`, are the settings on each file which determine who can use that file and how.

      `chmod` can be used in many ways so it takes a little more explaining than earlier commands.

      If you look at `man chmod` you’ll see that `chmod` accepts several different types of input, and has a lot more features than just the basic nine permissions. The essential points are:

      - `chmod` takes a mode and a file: `chmod mode file`
      - “`file`” is a path to the file you’d like to change (directories are files too)
      - “`mode`” can be written a number of ways; we’ll use “*symbolic mode*” here but you’ll likely see “*absolute mode*” (a numeric representation) in older examples

      *Symbolic* permission modes have a lot of shortcuts associated with them but we’ll focus on the basics here.

      - The mode should begin with any combination of “`u`” for user, “`g`” for group and “`o`” for other
      - Then follows an operator (just one): equals “`=`” assigns precisely the following permissions to the user/group/other category, plus “`+`” adds permissions, and minus “`-`” takes them away
      - Then follows a combination of “`r`” for read, “`w`” for write, and “`x`” for execute

      So as examples:
      To add execute permission for a user:
      ```
      chmod u+x <filename>
      ```

      To remove read and write permission for the group:
      ```
      chmod g-rw <filename>
      ```

      To add read permission for all roles:
      ```
      chmod ugo+r <file>
      ```

      ### Background: File Types

      Not all files appear as they really are. Just because you see a file named “`foo.png`” does not mean that there is PNG image data inside. It could be a text file hiding a secret message, or contain harmful executable code, or have been named by mistake.

      - File extensions are a convention for keeping things organized - not an enforced rule or a promise about what the file actually is. Whoever creates the file chooses its name and extension, however they like.

      So, how can you get more information on what a file actually contains? One way is with the “`file`” command!

      ### `file`

      To find out what a **file** really is regardless of its extension, you could examine the byte data inside, but `file` can often do this for us automatically.

      Try using "`file`" to inspect the files in the "multimedia-content" directory.

      ### `find`

      “`find`” does just what it sounds like - helps you “***find***” files on the filesystem. `find` takes different qualities that define what you’re looking for, and does the repetitive work of searching each directory in the tree work for you.

      An example:

      ```sh
      find . *foo*
      ```

      - First the “`.`” argument is a path that tells `find` where to start the search; in this case it's the current working directory. (Remember the dot is shorthand for the directory where you are. We could also give a relative path like “`bar`” or an absolute path from the root “`/`”. Wherever you’d like to search from.)
      - Second, we provide an expression for a filename. Here we’ve provided a glob pattern, “`*foo*`”. The `*`s on either side mean that we want everything with `foo` in the name, regardless of what is around it. The `*` can be any string, including an empty string, so “`foo`”, “`myfoo`”, “`foobar`” and “`space food vendors.txt`” would all be valid matches.

      # 3 File manipulation

      So far we’ve looked at commands that browse and alter the filesystem, where data is saved. Next we’ll introduce some command line programs for reading and writing the data inside files, as well as some shell features that give us greater power over storing and manipulating that data.

      ## Commands

      First we’ll take a look at some of the essential commands. Another term for CLI commands is “*utilities*” - you may have seen it used already in the `man` pages.

      ### `cat`

      Let's learn a new command, `cat`. `cat` prints out the text from a file.
      `cat` is short for “con**cat**enate”, which means “to connect, join or arrange”. If given more than one file argument, `cat` will print out each one in the order they’re specified, joining them (on the printed output, at least).
      But if you just want to print out a text file to the console, you can simply `cat <filename>`.

      ### `touch`

      “`touch`” is a command that "*touches*" a file. If the file exists `touch` updates its modified date. If the file does not exist, then an empty file will be created at that location.
 
      Why is this useful? There are many other ways to create new files, particularly when saving new data from other programs. But `touch` may be convenient when you only need an empty file.

      Then, why does it change the modification date? This is because `touch` is actually more often used as a scripting tool, when processing and organizing files for larger tasks. You may not need to `touch` files manually very often, but chances are you’ll come across its use in a script.


      ### `echo`

      `echo` is a simple and versatile command. It can evaluate an expression and write it to the terminal standard output (STDOUT, which we'll explain further below). You can use this in many different ways. A simple example is where the expression is a string literal.

      If you type:

      ```sh
      [username]@[host]$ echo "This is echoed"
      This is echoed
      ```

      You will see that it was repeated back to you.

      ### `md5sum`

      “`md5sum`” is way to determine whether a file has been modified.

      Since it is only a function of the file contents, it can also be used to check whether two files have the same contents.

      `md5sum` is called a “*cryptographic hash function*”. A “*hash function*” maps a large, possibly infinite set of values (in this case, all possible file contents) to a smaller set of values of a fixed size (here, 128 bits). A *cryptographic* hash function does so in such a way that it is hard to construct an input that maps to a given output - thus it is not easy to infer the content of the file just by its MD5 hash.

      If security is described as a balance between confidentiality, integrity and availability, commands like ‘md5sum’ help to provide the “*integrity*” property.

      ## Pager Utilities

      “*Pagers*” are a group of command line utilities that allows users to view text one page at a time. This is particularly useful when dealing with output that is too large to fit on a single screen, as it prevents the information from scrolling past too quickly to read.

      ### `less` and `more`

      The commands “`less`” and "*more*" are used to open larger files, page by page. they allow you more tools to read a file in an organized fashion than you might have just by scrolling through your terminal output.

      Like `man` pages, you can use `q` to exit them. (Fun fact, `man` is actually built on top of `more`)

      ### `tail`

      The “`tail`” command is used to display the last part of a file. By default, it shows the last ten lines, but you can customize its behavior using various options.

      - Custom line count: Use the `-n` option to specify the number of lines to display.
      - Real-time monitoring: With the `-f` option, `tail` can follow a file, displaying new lines as they are added. Run this way `tail` will continue even when it reaches the end of the file, waiting to print additional new lines. Press ^C to stop monitoring and return to the shell.

      `tail` is convenient when you don’t need or want to scroll manually. `less` can follow the tail of a file too, but it takes a few more keystrokes.

      ## Text Editors

      There are many ways to create and modify text files on the command line. When you need all the features of an interactive text editor, there are a number of choices.

      We use the minimal editor “`nano`” for most examples in eduRange unless otherwise stated. In these exercises, `nano` is all you’ll need, but we’ll mention a few common alternatives by name so you know them when you see them.
      
      ### `nano`

      Like the name implies, “`nano`” is a small text editor. Called with no arguments, it opens an editor session for an unnamed file; when you go to save, it will allow you to specify a path to write out to. Called with an argument, `nano` attempts to open and read the file at the path provided. If no file exists, a new one will be created when saving.

      As with `man` or `less`, once `nano` starts, it is controlled differently than the shell. If you type, your text will be entered into the file to be written. Text is inserted at the blinking cursor, which can be moved around with arrow keys. At the bottom of the screen is a summary of command keystrokes. (Remember, “`^`” is shorthand for the Control key modifier.)

      The most important are:

      - `^O` to “*write **o**ut*” (when you type you’re writing to a temporary buffer; it doesn’t save to the actual file until you write out)
      - `^X` to “*e**x**it*”
      - `^G` to “***g**et help*” if you’re curious about the others

      The keystrokes are case-insensitive.

      ### `vim` and `vi`

      You’ll probably come across references to `vim` or its predecessor `vi`. These have powerful tools related to searching and batch editing files, but we won’t have use for those features in this exercise.
      
      If you find yourself accidentally stuck in `vim` or `vi`, hit Escape, then type `:qa!` and press enter to forcefully exit.

      Vim can be very useful and productive, but it has a steep learning curve for all of its hotkeys.

      # Redirection, Filters and Command Composition

      ## Input/Output Redirection

      Redirection operators - written with angle brackets like “`>`” and “`<`” - are used to write the output of a command to a file or a file to the input of a command. They have many uses.

      ### Output Redirection With `>` and `>>`

      The “`>`” “*redirects output*” to a file. `<command> > <path>` will write a file to “`path`” with what is output by the “`command`” on the left hand side. If the file already exists, `>` will overwrite the file with what you sent it, in effect deleting the previous content. In contrast if you use `>>`, it will append what you sent to the end of the file, leaving the existing data intact.
      Let's give it a try. Try:

      ```sh
      echo "This is cool" > newfile
      cat newfile
      ```

      Next type:

      ```sh
      echo "This is cool too" > newfile
      cat newfile
      ```

      You can see that `>` will replace any text with what you send it, while `>>` will append to a file. Enter the following:

      ```sh
      echo "This is another thing" >> secondfile
      echo "Hello World" >> secondfile
      cat secondfile
      ```

      By using `>>`, both lines were saved to `secondfile`.

      Now let's use `>>` to combine the two files. Type:

      ```sh
      cat newfile >> secondfile
      cat secondfile
      ```

      You can see the contents of `newfile` appended to the end of `secondfile` whereas if you `cat newfile` it will still only have what we wrote to it earlier.

      Remember, `man bash` (or your particular shell) has the documentation on shell language features like redirection.

      ### Tip: Use Redirection to Filter Output Streams

      One useful trick you can do with redirection operators is suppress error messages.

      Say you have a command that produces lots of output (like searching through every sub-directory of a big directory with `find`) and sometimes that command produces errors (for instance when `find` tries to search a directory for which you don't have permissions).

      If you want to just focus on the normal output and suppress the error messages that may result, you can add '2>/dev/null' to your command. For example:

      ```sh
      find . filename 2>/dev/null
      ```

      ### Input and Output Redirection With Pipes `|`

      `<` and `>` and their relatives help get data to and from the command line to the filesystem. The “*pipe*” operator, written as “`|`”, takes the output of one command and provides it as the input to another command. This allows you to combine the functionality of two commands in a single statement, without needing to save the intermediate data to file.

      Consider a command like: `cat file1.txt file2.txt | more`

      This would pass the contents of both file1.txt and file2.txt into `more`, so you could read them both in a combined pager.

      Not particularly useful, but the idea is you can pass the results of one command into another with pipes. 

      This becomes very powerful when using commands that "*Filter*"

      ## Filters

      “*Filters*” are a category of commands that take input (generally text), apply some operation to the input and then print the result back out to standard output. Some examples of operations could be sorting, searching or counting.

      ### `sort`

      The “`sort`” command is a tool that is used to **sort** lines of text. It’s handy for sorting lists that are out of order. It can sort specific columns or entire lines alphabetically, numerically, or even in reverse order.

      `sort` by default will sort the list in alphabetical order according to the first letter of each line. Lowercase characters are listed before uppercase letters.

      - The option `-r` sorts the list in reverse order.
      - The option `-n` will sort the list numerically.
      - You can sort a specific column using the option `-k` and a numeric argument.

      One use for the `sort` command is to reorder the output of a shell command, such as `ls', through the use of a pipe.

      That should take the form of `<source> | <filter>' where: 
      - “`source`” is the `ls` output you want to `sort` and
      - “`filter`” is the `sort` command and relevant options.

      ### `uniq`

      The `uniq` command is used to reduce the number of repeated lines that are printed while viewing a file, and, as a result, it is very often used with `sort` (using a pipe). 
      Such as: `cat <file> | sort | uniq`
      
      It only prints the first instance of a line, and does not print repetitions of that line that follow after that instance. 
      Though it’s called “***uniq**ue*”, `uniq` doesn’t guarantee to remove all repetitions - just those that follow one another.

      ### `grep`

      The “`grep`” command has a similar use to `find`, however, instead of searching for files, `grep` searches within files for lines that contain a string you specify. Unlike the *glob patterns* used by `find`, `grep` uses a convention called *regular expressions*.

      “`grep`” stands for “**g**lobal / **r**egular **e**xpression search / and **p**rint” - originally it was a series of commands in an editor, but was so useful someone turned it into a utility of its own. The general syntax of the command is:

      `grep [pattern] [file ...]`

      Some options for `grep` include:

      - Case insensitivity (“`-i`”)
      - Only print the filename that contains the pattern (“`-l`”)
      - Print out line numbers along with the matching criteria (“`-n`”)
      - Print lines that do not match the criteria (“`-v`”).

      #### Regular Expressions

      “*Regular expressions*” are another style of text patterns. They have similar basic uses to globs, but are much more complex and powerful. We’ll only present a few of their applications here.

      First, note that some symbols and ideas are shared between regular expressions (“*regexes*”) and glob-style patterns. The “`*`” is not a wildcard in a regex, but it does something similar; when “`*`” follows a sub-pattern in a regex, the resulting pattern matches zero or more occurrences of the sub-pattern.

      Regexes allow you to specify the number of matches separately from the expression that is matched, whereas glob wildcards do both in a single symbol. Here globs are shorter, but regexes are more flexible.

      ### Combine the filters flexibly

      Putting it all together, you can chain these filters in a number of different ways.
      
      Say if you wanted to read a file, look only at lines that contain "foo", and then filter down to only unique lines, you could do something like:
      
      ```
      cat <file> | grep -i "*foo*" | sort | uniq
      ```
