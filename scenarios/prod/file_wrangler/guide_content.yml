      ### How to Connect
      Use the credentials and IP address provided in the bottom left of this 
      scenario page to SSH into the exercise. 
      
      SSH is an important network protocol that is used in most of our 
      scenarios, so you need some minimal knowledge on how to use it on your OS.
      
      If you need a backup, you can use the WebSSH button also in the bottom 
      left, but it is missing many convenience features provided by more 
      standard terminals.

      “*`man` pages*" is short for “**man**ual” pages. These are text documents
      with lots of information on things installed on your system. “`man`” is a
      command for reading the `man` pages.

      Try opening the "`man`" page for `ls` using:
      ```
      man ls
      ```
      To exit `man`, just type "`q`" to “***q**uit*”.

      ### `man` Page Key Points: SYNOPSIS and EXAMPLES

      For many commands, there’s an overwhelming amount of information in the `man` pages. The pages are divided up into sections.

      Most every `man` page includes two particularly useful sections:

      - A *synopsis* showing how the command is written in the format discussed earlier, and 
      - A series of *examples* showing exact instances of the command in particular uses.

      When in a `man` page, you can type a slash “`/`” to search for text.

      The headers are in all capitals, so after opening up a particular page, to search for the synopsis you’d type:

      ```sh
      /SYNOPSIS
      ```

      and then hit enter.

      - `man` will highlight all instances of the text “`SYNOPSIS`”.
      - Typing “`n`” will bring you to the “**n**ext” search result.
      - “`b`” will take you “**b**ack”.
      - Remember, “`q`” to “**q**uit” when you’re done.

      - `man` pages are an important resource because they are specific to the software actually installed on the system you’re currently using.
      - Some commands have different behavior depending on their version.
      - An online resource may or may not have information specific to your system, but `man` always contains documentation for what you have installed.
