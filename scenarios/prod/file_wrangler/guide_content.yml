      ## Task 4
      Steps:
      1. View the manual entry for the `ls` command. Notice in the `SYNOPSIS`, the format of the command is as follows:
         `ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...`
         Anything in square brackets is optional. In this case, we can use `ls` along with one of the options listed with `-` or `--` and we could add a complete file path.
      2. Scroll through the manual to find the option that will provide a long listing format for the `ls` command.
      3. Answer question 4 in EDURange.

      ## Task 6
      Hidden files begin with a `'.'` and are not displayed unless you specify an option with the `ls` command.

      You can chain options for a single command. So, for example, you could include both the options for long listing and listing hidden files by simply adding each option after the `ls` command.
