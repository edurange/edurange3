      ## What is Metasploit
      Metasploit is a framework for automating the process of exploiting vulnerabilities in application software. It has tools to support the cyber kill chain. which consists of the steps: 
      - reconnaissance, identifying the target and software services running on the target
      - finding vulnerabilities, this may include CVEs for the specific software versions running on the target and severity of the vulnerabilities
      - weaponization, identifying exploits that could be used for the vulnerabilities
      - delivery, in order to get the exploit to the target, it may be necessary to bypass firewalls
      - exploitation, choosing a payload, producing packets that contain the exploit with payload and delivering them to the target
      - persistence, creating accounts, backdoors, beacons, etc.

      ## Learning Objectives
      - use the Metasploit shell.
      - identify targets and services running on open ports
      - given the service running and the version, find known vulnerabilities and severity.
      - find exploits provided by the Metasploit framework to use.
      - use the Metasploit Framework to exploit a vulnerable service.

      ## Basic Metasploit Commands 

      > Square brackets indicate the command input.

      - `msfconsole`: opens the Metasploit shell, which allows for Metasploit commands to be run.

      - `help`: when used alone, shows the possible options; when used with a command as input, shows information on the specified command.

      - `search [search_term]`: searches the Metasploit vulnerability database and returns the available exploit module names.

      - `use [module_name]`: tells Metasploit which exploit is being used.

      - `back`: tells Metasploit to stop using the current exploit.

      - `options`: shows the options that can be set for the exploit currently in use. (NOTE: some options are required for the exploit to be run.)

      - `set [option] [value]`: sets the given option to the given value for the exploit currently in use.

      - `exploit`: tells Metasploit to try to run the current exploit.

      - `exit`: can be used to exit the Metasploit command line and return to the bash shell (`quit` can be used for the same purpose).

      > Note: options such as RHOSTS which holds information for the target ip address will likely have to be set for each exploit used.

      ### Example use of Metasploit

      The following is an example use of the metasploit framework that has been generalized to show how the given commands can be used.

      <!--![Metasploit Command Line Example](/assets/img/Metasploitable/m-h_example_cmd_line.png)-->

      ## Services

      The following is a list of the types of vulnerable services provided by Metasploitable

      - A compiler

      - An internet relay chat (irc)

      - Two file transfer protocols (ftp)

      - An http service (php_cgi)

      - An sql database

      ## Information

      Once you have logged into the attacker machine, you should be able to run nmap, which is the standard tool for scanning a target. The use of nmap
      is covered in the scenarios SSH_inception and Total Recon. In this exercise, the target machine can be accessed using the keyword `target` instead of scanning a network to find the IP Address.

      It is recommended that when you scan the target machine, to scan all ports from 0 to 65535. Once you have identified the open ports you can narrow down the range of ports that you scan for additional information.

      When you scan the target machine you should see 15 open ports.

      The next step is to identify services with known vulnerabilites.

      When looking for exploits to use on a service, we highly recommend that you only try exploits that are ranked `excellent`.

      ## Example Use of Metasploit
      #

      Using a basic nmap scan, we can see that an http service is running on port 80. This service will be used as an example of how to use Metasploit. 

      Open the Metasploit shell using `msfconsole`

      Use the Metasploit search command to find a usable http exploit. Notice that if you just search for http (`search http`), you will be given a few over two thousand results. This is a few results too many, so instead we can search for `php_cgi` to find a single usable result. Note that in other cases the number of results will be more managable, so do not worry about trying to search for specific exploits with other services.

      Using `search php_cgi` will give us one result. We can now use the `use` command followed by the exploit name to tell Metasploit that we want to use this exploit.

      Once we are using the exploit we can now make sure that all of the exploits options are properly set. To do so, we will use the `options` command.

      The options command shows us that there are four required options, and that three of them are already set. We can use the `set` command to set the `RHOSTS` option. The `RHOSTS` option specifies the target address. `set RHOSTS target`

      Once all the required options are set, we can use the `exploit` command to run the exploit.

      Some exploits will result in a meterpreter shell, we can get to a normal shell by entering the command `shell`.
