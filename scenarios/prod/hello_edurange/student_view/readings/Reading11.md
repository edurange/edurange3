## Final Mission
Here at CyberSec you have been well trained recruit, now let's put your training to test! This is a real mission of the utmost importance. Complete this and you are assured a spot on our team.

TASK: Our intelligence has told us that somewhere in your computer is an image that is vital to our company. This image has a weird name but we know for certain that it contains the word `cowFJS` in it. This file is somewhere on the system, but it is NOT in your home directory. Through our sources we also know that there is ANOTHER file in that folder. COPY both the image and second file to your home directory in a new folder, called `final-mission`. Then create a new file in the folder, `final-mission`, called `cowsay.file` with the contents of the cowsay man file in it.
